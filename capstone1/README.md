PRESENTATION OF THE PROJECT

1.1 General Presentation of Project
DasTern is a Khmer-friendly mobile healthcare application developed to assist Cambodian patients in managing their medication effectively after hospital discharge. The project focuses on addressing common challenges faced by patients, particularly elderly individuals and those living in rural areas, such as forgetting medication schedules, losing prescription documents, language barriers, and limited digital literacy.
The application leverages Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology to scan medical prescriptions and automatically extract essential medication information, including medicine names, dosage, and intake frequency. Based on the extracted data, DasTern generates personalized medication reminder schedules to help users follow their prescribed treatments accurately.
To ensure accessibility and ease of use, the system is designed with Khmer language support, Khmer text-to-speech voice reminders, and offline functionality, allowing users to receive reminders even without an active internet connection. The user interface is intentionally kept simple and intuitive to accommodate users with minimal experience in digital technology.
DasTern is developed as a mobile application with a modular system architecture that supports future scalability and feature expansion. The project aims to provide a reliable, automated, and user-centered solution that improves medication adherence, reduces medication errors, and enhances patient recovery outcomes. The development of this project is divided into two phases: Capstone 1, which focuses on analysis, design, and prototyping, and Capstone 2, which will involve full system implementation and testing.












1.1.1. Project Organization



Figure 1 illustrates the member structure of the DasTern system.


1.1.2. Project Overview
DasTern is a mobile health application designed to help Cambodian patients correctly follow their prescribed medication schedules after hospital visits. Many patients forget medicine times, lose prescription slips, or have trouble understanding medical instructions written in English. These challenges reduce treatment effectiveness and increase hospital readmissions.
The DasTern system utilizes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from prescription images, allowing patients to scan their medical slip directly. AI text enhancement using DeepSeek improves the accuracy of extracted medicine names, dosages, and instructions. The backend generates a structured medication schedule, which is then presented to the user with clear timing and reminders in Khmer.
The application includes:
OCR extraction from prescription images
AI-enhanced text cleaning
Automatic reminder scheduling
Khmer user interface
Khmer text-to-speech notifications
Telegram family notifications
Offline access
Tracking of taken/missed doses


Designed for accessibility, DasTern particularly supports elderly users, low-literacy individuals, and rural communities. The solution enhances treatment adherence and improves overall health outcomes.

1.2. Problematic
In Cambodia, patients often face significant challenges after hospital discharge, including forgetting medicine times, losing prescription slips, difficulty navigating English-based medical applications, and limited digital literacy. Elderly patients in particular may struggle to manage their medication schedules without external assistance.

LITERATURE REVIEW
3.1. Medication Adherence Challenges
Medication adherence is a critical factor in achieving positive health outcomes, particularly for patients managing chronic or post-hospitalization treatments. The World Health Organization has reported that nearly 50% of patients with chronic diseases fail to take their medications as prescribed, leading to worsening conditions, preventable complications, and increased healthcare costs. These challenges are more pronounced among elderly patients and individuals living in rural or low-resource settings, where limited health literacy, language barriers, and lack of follow-up support are common issues.
In Cambodia, patients often rely on paper-based prescriptions and verbal instructions from doctors, which can easily be lost or misunderstood. Elderly patients may forget medication schedules, misinterpret dosage instructions, or be unable to read prescriptions written in English. These factors contribute significantly to medication errors and reduced treatment effectiveness.

3.2. Mobile Health Applications for Medication Management

Mobile health (mHealth) applications have gained attention as effective tools for improving medication adherence. Numerous studies indicate that reminder-based mobile applications can significantly improve patients’ ability to take medications on time. A systematic review of mHealth interventions found that applications incorporating medication reminders, tracking features, and user feedback mechanisms were associated with improved adherence rates compared to traditional care alone (Thakkar et al., 2016).
Further research highlights that mobile reminder systems are most effective when they are personalized and easy to use. Apps that allow users to log medication intake and receive timely notifications help establish routine behavior and reduce forgetfulness. However, despite their potential benefits, many existing medication reminder applications rely heavily on manual data entry, which can be challenging for elderly users or those with limited digital literacy.

3.3. Limitations of Existing Medication Reminder Applications

Although many commercial medication reminder applications exist, several studies have identified critical limitations. Research analyzing medication apps available in app stores revealed that most applications lack clinical validation and are not designed with healthcare professionals’ involvement. Additionally, many apps offer only basic reminder functionality without addressing usability concerns for vulnerable populations such as elderly or low-literacy users (Grindrod et al., 2018).
Another major limitation is language accessibility. Most medication management applications are designed primarily for English-speaking users, making them less suitable for populations where English proficiency is low. Furthermore, few applications provide voice-based reminders or visual aids that could support users who struggle with reading.

3.4. OCR and AI-Based Prescription Processing

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology has been increasingly explored in healthcare systems to digitize medical documents and reduce manual data entry. OCR enables the extraction of text from printed or handwritten prescriptions, transforming them into structured digital data. Studies show that OCR-based systems can improve accuracy and efficiency in handling medical records when combined with preprocessing and text-cleaning techniques.
Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have further enhanced OCR accuracy, particularly in medical contexts. AI-based text enhancement models can correct recognition errors, standardize medication names, and improve readability. While several studies propose OCR-based prescription processing systems, their adoption in patient-facing mobile applications remains limited. Most existing solutions are designed for hospital administration rather than direct patient use.

3.5. Family and Caregiver Involvement in Medication Adherence

Research indicates that family and caregiver involvement plays a significant role in improving medication adherence, especially for elderly patients. Studies in health informatics emphasize that caregiver-supported monitoring systems can reduce missed doses and improve treatment outcomes. However, many medication management applications focus solely on patient reminders and do not include mechanisms for family members to monitor adherence or receive alerts.
Digital systems that notify caregivers when a patient misses a dose have shown promising results in improving accountability and support. Despite this, caregiver-inclusive features are still underrepresented in existing mHealth applications.

3.6. Competitor Analysis of Existing Systems

Several existing applications provide medication reminder functionalities, yet they exhibit notable limitations when compared to the proposed DasTern system.
Medisafe

Medisafe is a popular medication reminder application that allows users to manually input medication schedules and receive notifications. While effective in reminder delivery, Medisafe relies entirely on user-entered data and does not support OCR-based prescription scanning. Additionally, it lacks full localization for Khmer language users.

MyTherapy

MyTherapy offers medication reminders and adherence tracking combined with health journals. Similar to Medisafe, medication entry is manual, which increases the risk of errors and reduces usability for elderly patients. The application also requires continuous internet access and does not provide offline reminder functionality.

CareZone
CareZone includes prescription management and caregiver access. However, its interface complexity and English-only design limit accessibility for low-literacy or non-English-speaking users. OCR support is limited and not optimized for structured medication extraction.
Gap Identified
From the comparison, several gaps are evident:
Lack of automated prescription data entry via OCR
Limited AI-assisted text correction for medical terms
Absence of Khmer language and voice support
Inadequate offline functionality
Minimal family monitoring integration in low-resource settings
DasTern addresses these gaps by combining OCR, AI-enhanced text processing, Khmer localization, offline reminders, and family notification features in a single integrated solution.

3.7. Positioning of the DasTern Project

DasTern addresses these identified gaps by integrating OCR technology to automatically extract prescription information, eliminating the need for manual data entry. The system enhances OCR results using AI-based text cleaning to improve accuracy. Unlike many existing applications, DasTern is designed specifically for Cambodian users, offering a full Khmer-language interface, Khmer text-to-speech reminders, and offline access.
Additionally, DasTern incorporates family notification features through platforms such as Telegram, enabling caregivers to monitor medication adherence and receive alerts when doses are missed. By focusing on accessibility, automation, and caregiver involvement, DasTern contributes a user-centered and localized solution that extends beyond the capabilities of existing medication management applications.

Option 2: Tesseract OCR
Tesseract OCR is considered as an alternative and future option where the team can build and train its own OCR model, especially for Khmer prescriptions. This approach reduces dependency on external services and avoids data limitations caused by cloud-based APIs. By training the OCR model with local prescription samples, the system can achieve better accuracy for Cambodian medical documents.

Designed the overall architecture including mobile app, web API, and database structure.
Created UML diagrams and data flow models to visualize system components.
Designed a relational database schema using MySQL for storing users, prescriptions, and appointments.
Backend Development (Next.js)
Built RESTful APIs using Next.js API routes to handle authentication, medication schedules, and appointment data.
Integrated logic for notification scheduling and OCR text extraction results.
Implemented data encryption and secure database communication to ensure privacy.
Mobile Application Development (Flutter)
Developed a cross-platform mobile app for patients and families.
Implemented features for medication reminders, appointment booking, and Khmer text-to-speech (TTS) for voice guidance.
Supported offline mode, allowing users to view schedules and reminders without the internet.
OCR Integration
Integrated a free OCR model (Tesseract OCR) to scan and extract text from medical prescriptions in Khmer and English.
Parsed extracted data to detect medicine names, dosages, and timing automatically.
Allowed users to confirm extracted details before reminders were set.
Database Development (MySQL)
Designed relational tables for patient data, prescriptions, reminders, and appointments.
Ensured proper indexing and relationships between entities for fast and accurate data retrieval.
Applied validation rules to prevent duplicate or missing entries.
Testing and Evaluation
Conducted unit and integration testing to verify app functionality and OCR accuracy.
Tested notification reliability and offline performance on Android devices.
Collected feedback from sample users to evaluate Khmer language clarity, usability, and OCR precision.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
7.1. OCR Research and Workflow Design
7.1.1. Prescription Image Acquisition

The OCR workflow begins when the user (doctor or patient) accesses the Scan Prescription feature from the mobile application.
Process:
The mobile camera interface opens with a guided frame to help users align the prescription.
The user captures a clear image of the printed prescription.
The image is temporarily stored and prepared for processing.
Design Considerations:
Clear visual guidance to assist elderly users
Minimal buttons to reduce confusion
Option to retake the image if quality is poor

7.1.2. OCR Text Extraction

Once the image is captured, it is passed to the OCR module for text recognition.
OCR Processing Steps:

Image preprocessing (cropping, contrast enhancement, noise reduction)
Text region detection
Character recognition
Raw text extraction
At this stage, the extracted text may contain:
Spelling errors
Inconsistent spacing
Abbreviations
OCR misrecognitions
Therefore, raw OCR output alone is insufficient for reliable medication scheduling.
7.1.3. AI-Enhanced Text Processing

To address OCR inaccuracies, DasTern integrates an AI-assisted text enhancement layer.
The AI layer improves OCR results by:
Correcting spelling mistakes
Standardizing medical terms
Identifying key medication attributes
Converting unstructured text into structured data
This step significantly improves system reliability, especially for users with limited ability to manually edit extracted text.


7.3. User Input for Personalized Scheduling

Because medication timing often depends on meal habits, the system prompts the user to enter their daily meal schedule. This step ensures reminders are personalized and medically accurate.
Required Inputs:
Breakfast time
Lunch time
Dinner time
Example User input
Breakfast: 08:00 AM
Lunch: 01:00 PM
Dinner: 07:30 PM



7.4. Medication Reminder Generation Logic

Using the structured medication data and user meal times, DasTern automatically generates reminder schedules.
Example Reminder Calculation

Medicine
Frequency
Timing
Generated Reminder Time
Paracetamol
3/day
After meal
08:15, 13:15, 19:45
Amoxicillin
2/day
Before meal
07:45, 19:15

The reminder logic accounts for:
Meal-based offsets (before/after meal)
Multiple daily doses
Consistent spacing between doses

7.5. Notification and Monitoring Integration
Once reminders are generated:
push notifications are scheduled locally (offline supported)
Missed doses trigger alert logic
Family members receive Telegram notifications if enabledP
 
7.6. UX/UI Prototyping (Low-Fidelity and High-Fidelity)

The user interface and user experience of the DasTern application were developed through an iterative prototyping process.
Low-fidelity wireframes were first created to define basic layouts, navigation flow, and screen hierarchy for patients, doctors, and family members.
High-fidelity prototypes were then designed using Figma to represent the final look and feel of the application, including colors, icons, typography, and interaction behaviors.
Special attention was given to usability and accessibility, particularly for elderly users and individuals with limited digital literacy. Khmer language support, large buttons, simple navigation, and visual clarity were emphasized throughout the design. As a result, approximately 95% of the full application prototype has been completed in Figma, covering all major user flows.
7.6.1. Patient Interface Implementation
The patient interface includes the following implemented screens:
Home Dashboard
Displays today’s medication status
Upcoming reminders
Missed dose alerts


OCR Scan Screen
Camera-based prescription capture
OCR processing feedback
Editable extracted medication list


Medication Schedule Screen
Daily medication timeline
Taken / missed indicators


Reminder Confirmation Screen
Meal-based reminder preview


Settings Screen
Meal time preferences
Language and notification controls


UX flow was validated by simulating real scenarios such as patients having different meal times (e.g., breakfast at 7 AM vs 10 AM).
7.6.2. Doctor Interface Implementation
The doctor interface prototype was designed to support clinical monitoring and continuity of care. Implemented UI components include:
Doctor Home Dashboard
Patient list with follow-up status
Alerts for non-adherent patients
Graph-based overview (instead of raw numbers)


Patient Detail View
Age, gender, disease history
Previous prescriptions (from same and other doctors)
Last visit date and illness start date


Prescription Creation Interface
Structured medicine entry
Frequency and meal relation selection


Patient Record View
Historical treatment overview
This design aligns with advisor feedback emphasizing what doctors want to know quickly.
7.6.3. Family Interface Implementation
The family interface enables caregiver monitoring:
Family Dashboard
Linked patient summary
Daily adherence status


Patient Timeline View
Taken and missed medication logs


Notification Log
Alerts received via app and Telegram


Patient Linking Screen
QR code / Patient ID linking


UX design ensures family members have view-only access, preventing unauthorized changes.

CONCLUSION
The DasTern project successfully demonstrates a functional and culturally appropriate solution to Cambodia’s medication adherence challenges.
